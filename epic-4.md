# Epic 4: Music Upload & Management

- **Goal:** To allow group members to upload, manage, and share their music files.
- **Story 4.1:** Music File Upload API: As a developer, I need a secure endpoint to process, store, and create a database record for an uploaded audio file, associating it with one or more groups.
- **Story 4.2:** Music Upload UI: As a member, I want a form to select an audio file, add metadata, and choose one or more groups to upload it to.
- **Story 4.3:** Display Songs in Group View: As a member, I want to see a list of all uploaded songs within the "Group View Page."
- **Story 4.4:** Song Deletion UI & API: As the uploader, I want a "delete" option to permanently remove my track.
