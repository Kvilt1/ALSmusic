# Epic 1: Initial Rebranding & Styling

- **Goal:** To remove all existing Spotify branding from the application and establish the new "ALSmusic" brand identity with an orange and black color scheme.
- **Story 1.1:** Replace Logos and Favicons: As a user, I want to see the ALSmusic logo and favicon throughout the application.
- **Story 1.2:** Update Color Scheme: As a user, I want the application's color scheme to be orange and black instead of green and black.
- **Story 1.3:** Update Text and Naming: As a user, I want all text within the application to refer to 'ALSmusic' instead of 'Spotify'.
