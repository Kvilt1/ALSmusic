# Epic 5: In-Group Music Playback & Navigation

- **Goal:** To provide a seamless music playback experience and ensure all navigation links work correctly.
- **Story 5.1:** Basic Music Playback: As a member, I want to click any song in a group and have it play in the player bar.
- **Story 5.2:** Play Queue Logic: As a listener, when I play a song, I want the rest of the songs in the list to be added to a "play next" queue.
- **Story 5.3:** User Profile Page Implementation: As a user, I want to click an uploader's name to see their profile page with all their tracks.
- **Story 5.4:** Finalize All Navigation Links: As a user, I want all links (group names, user profiles) to navigate to the correct page.
