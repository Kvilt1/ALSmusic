The sharding task is complete. All relevant sections from the PRD and Architecture documents have been extracted into their own dedicated files, and a central index has been created.
The next logical step is to engage the SM (Scrum Master) agent to draft the first story for development, which would be Story 2.1: Basic Project & API Setup.
Shall I switch to the SM persona to draft this story?
